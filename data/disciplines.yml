            ### 1st Mixer:

            While head-down, the pair flies forwards, crossing through the
            Sidelines, and then performs one-half outface Eagle, crossing
            through the Sidelines, into 180° of head-up outface carving in
            opposite directions, with P#1 crossing a Sideline and P#2 crossing
            the other Sideline. While head-up, both Performers, as a pair, fly
            backwards, crossing through the Sidelines, and then perform one-half
            inface Reverse Eagle, crossing through the Sidelines again to
            head-down. The pair then flies directly through the Sidelines,
            presenting their backs to each other into 180° of inface carving in
            opposite directions, with P#1 crossing a Sideline and P#2 crossing
            the other Sideline. Joining as a pair, the Performers fly forwards,
            crossing through the Sidelines. Thence...
