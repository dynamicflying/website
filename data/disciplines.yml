          Performers cross the Start Sideline in a head-down inface orientation and remain in head-down inface
          carving during the entire Pattern. Performers begin by carving towards the Performers' left in the first
          and third Snake (right in the second Snake). When passing through the centre the first time, each
          Performer changes to carving towards his/her right in the first and third Snake (left in the second Snake).
          When passing through the centre the second time, each Performer changes to carving towards his/her
          left in the first and third Snake (right in the second Snake).
