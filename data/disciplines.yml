            P#1, followed by P#2 through P#4, must completely cross the vertical plane defined by the Sidelines.
            The Performers may cross this vertical plane in any orientation. Maintaining sequential order, the
            Performers must flow counterclockwise (with respect to the top view) into the first Snake.

            Performers cross the Start Sideline in a head-down inface orientation and remain in head-down inface
            carving during the entire Pattern. Performers begin by carving towards the Performers' left in the first
            and third Snake (right in the second Snake). When passing through the centre the first time, each
            Performer changes to carving towards his/her right in the first and third Snake (left in the second Snake).
            When passing through the centre the second time, each Performer changes to carving towards his/her
            left in the first and third Snake (right in the second Snake).
